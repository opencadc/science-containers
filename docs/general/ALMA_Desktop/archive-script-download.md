# Download data from the ALMA archive (transfer script) 

Downloading data from the ALMA archive directly using a web query is
shown in [this tutorial](archive-download.md). 
Some users, however, may prefer to interact with the ALMA
archive on their local machine and instead transfer the resulting data
download script to their Desktop session. For more information on using
the archive query effectively, see this instructional video:
<https://almascience.nrao.edu/alma-data/archive/archive-video-tutorials>

Once you have a data download script on your local computer, there are a
variety of methods to [transfer files](../../data-transfer-guide.md)
into your Science Portal diskspace. Once the script is
uploaded and thus accessible to your Desktop session, you can run the
script within a terminal container and download the data, as shown in
[this tutorial](archive-download.md).
