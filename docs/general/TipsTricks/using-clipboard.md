# Copy & Paste Between Desktop Containers 

Since the different containers (e.g., CASA and terminal windows) on a
Desktop session may not be running on the same remote computer, copying
and pasting text from one container into another is not quite as simple
as when using a personal desktop machine. To copy and paste within a
Desktop session, you need to make use of an intermediary application
called the Clipboard. To find the Clipboard, click on the arrow at the
far left of the Desktop.

This brings up a menu with several different applications. The Clipboard
is in about the middle of the list and can be opened by clicking on it.

The Clipboard functions as an intermediary place to put text that you
wish to transfer from one container session to another. You can copy
highlighted / selected text using `Control-Shift-C`, and paste it using
`Control-Shift-V`.

In the example here, a line of code is being copied from a python
program (being edited in a normal terminal window) into a running
interactive CASA session. In the first step, the text is highlighted in
the terminal window. Usually, this highlighted text directly transfers
into the Clipboard.

Next, highlight the text on the Clipboard, and type `Control-Shift-C`.
Then, click on the CASA terminal and type `Control-Shift-V` to paste the
text there.

This same process applies to all other copy-paste needs as well, for
example, from a web browser window into a terminal.
