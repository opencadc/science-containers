## Still Not Sure?

### For Radio Astronomers
Start with **Desktop** to access CASA, then try **CARTA** for data visualization.

### For Optical/IR Astronomers  
Start with **Notebooks** for data analysis, then explore **Desktop** for DS9 and other tools.

### For Data Scientists
**Notebooks** will feel most familiar and provide the best Python data science environment.
