## Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostic Steps

When you encounter issues, try these steps first:

1. **Check system status**: Look for maintenance announcements
2. **Try a different browser**: Chrome and Firefox work best
3. **Clear browser cache**: Remove cookies and cached data
4. **Try incognito mode**: Eliminates browser extension conflicts
5. **Check your network**: Ensure stable internet connection

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Session Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Session creation fails or hangs

**Solutions**:
- Reduce resource requirements (memory/CPU)
- Try during off-peak hours (evenings, weekends)
- Select a different container image
- Check group permissions

#### Can't Access Files

**Symptoms**: Files missing or permission denied

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check file locations
ls /arc/home/$(whoami)/     # Personal storage
ls /arc/projects/           # Group storage

# Check permissions
ls -la /arc/projects/mygroup/
```

- Verify you're in the correct group
- Check file paths are correct
- Contact group administrator

#### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: Slow processing or unresponsive interface

**Solutions**:
- Monitor resource usage with `htop`
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use scratch storage (`/tmp/`) for temporary files
- Consider requesting more resources

#### Browser Compatibility

**Symptoms**: Interface doesn't load or behaves incorrectly

**Solutions**:
- Use Chrome or Firefox (recommended)
- Enable JavaScript and cookies
- Disable ad blockers for canfar.net
- Update browser to latest version

### Diagnostic Commands

Use these commands to gather information for support requests:

```bash
# System information
uname -a
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | head -1
free -h
df -h

# Session information
echo $USER
groups
env | grep -E "(CANFAR|SESSION)"

# Network connectivity
ping -c 3 canfar.net
curl -I https://canfar.net
```
