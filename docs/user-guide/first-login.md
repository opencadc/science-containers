# First Login to CANFAR

## Accessing the Portal

Once you have a CADC account with portal authorization:

## Login Process

1. **Click "Login"** in the top-right corner
2. **Enter your CADC credentials**
   - Username: Your CADC username

## Key Concepts

### Sessions
**Sessions** are your running applications (like Jupyter notebooks or desktop environments). 
Think of them as virtual computers dedicated to your work. You can have up to **3 sessions** 
running simultaneously. Each session:

- Runs for up to 4 days before automatic renewal
- Persists when you close your browser (you can reconnect later)
- Has dedicated computing resources (CPU cores and memory)
- Shares access to your file storage

### Storage Structure
Your files are organized in a logical hierarchy designed for collaboration:

```
/arc/home/username     ‚Üê Your private space (configs, personal files)
/arc/projects/group    ‚Üê Shared project data and results  
```

### Session Limits
- **Maximum sessions**: 3 concurrent sessions
- **Session duration**: 4 days (renewable by clicking the clock icon)
- **Renewal**: Click ‚è∞ on any session to extend it
