# Launching Contributed Applications

**Access community-developed tools and specialized research applications**

Contributed applications are specialized tools developed by the CANFAR community and external collaborators. These applications provide unique interfaces and capabilities not available in standard session types, often targeting specific astronomical workflows or research domains.

## üéØ What are Contributed Applications?

Contributed applications are web-based tools that:

- **Extend CANFAR's capabilities** beyond standard notebook/desktop sessions
- **Provide specialized interfaces** for specific research tasks  
- **Integrate with CANFAR storage** and authentication systems
