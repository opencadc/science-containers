casa --gui

# Or use the interactive shell
casa
```

The desktop environment allows you to use CASA's plotting and visualization 
tools that aren't available in command-line mode.

## Desktop Session Tips

### Copy & Paste Between Containers

Since different containers (e.g., CASA and terminal windows) in a desktop session may run on different remote computers, copying and pasting text between containers requires using the **Clipboard** application.

#### Accessing the Clipboard

1. **Open the Clipboard**: Click the arrow at the far left of the desktop to open the application menu
2. **Find Clipboard**: Look for "Clipboard" in the middle of the application list and click it

> ![Desktop with Clipboard Menu](../images/clipboard/2_desktop_with_clipboard_menu.png)

#### Using the Clipboard

The Clipboard serves as an intermediary for transferring text between containers:

1. **Copy text**: Highlight text in the source container and use `Ctrl+Shift+C`
2. **Transfer via Clipboard**: The text should appear in the Clipboard application
3. **Select in Clipboard**: Highlight the text in the Clipboard and press `Ctrl+Shift+C`
4. **Paste to target**: Click in the destination container and use `Ctrl+Shift+V`

> ![Copying Text Between Containers](../images/clipboard/4_text_into_clipboard.png)

!!! tip "Keyboard Shortcuts"
    - **Copy**: `Ctrl+Shift+C`
    - **Paste**: `Ctrl+Shift+V`
    - These shortcuts work consistently across all desktop containers

### Adjusting Font Size

Desktop containers support adjustable font sizes for better readability:

#### Changing Terminal Font Size

1. **Access font menu**: Hold `Ctrl` and right-click anywhere in a terminal window
2. **Select size**: Choose from the available font size options (Small, Medium, Large)
3. **Apply immediately**: Font changes take effect instantly

> ![Font Size Adjustment](../images/font/2_fontsize_popup.png)

This feature works in:
- Terminal windows
- CASA command-line interface
- Text-based applications

!!! note "Font Persistence"
    Font size changes apply only to the current session. You'll need to readjust when starting new sessions.

## File Management

### Storage Access

Your desktop session provides access to:

- **`/arc/projects/[group]/`**: Shared project storage
- **`/arc/home/[username]/`**: Personal persistent storage
- **`/home/[username]/`**: Session-local home directory
- **`/tmp/`**: Temporary scratch space

!!! warning "Persistence Reminder"
    Use `/arc/projects/` or `/arc/home/` for important files. The session-local home and `/tmp/` are not guaranteed to persist after the session ends.

### File Operations

Use the graphical file manager for:

- **Drag-and-drop**: Move files between directories
- **Visual browsing**: Preview images and data files
- **Batch operations**: Select multiple files for operations
- **Permissions**: Set file and directory permissions

### Data Transfer

Transfer files to/from your desktop session:

- **Browser upload**: Use Science Portal file manager
