# Accounts & Permissions

**Managing users, groups, and access control on CANFAR**

This section covers everything you need to know about user management, group permissions, and access control on the CANFAR platform. Whether you're setting up a new collaboration or managing an existing team, this guide will help you understand and configure permissions effectively.

## üéØ Overview

CANFAR's permission system is built on several layers:

1. **CADC Accounts** - Your base identity for accessing Canadian astronomy services
2. **Groups** - Collections of users for collaborative access 
3. **Harbor Permissions** - Container registry access control
4. **ACL (Access Control Lists)** - File-level permissions
5. **API Authentication** - Programmatic access control

## üë• Groups and User Management

### Understanding Groups

Groups are the foundation of collaboration on CANFAR. A group defines:

- **Who** can access shared resources
- **What** projects and storage they can use
- **How** they can interact (read, write, admin)

### Group Hierarchy

    Resources --> Projects[üìÅ /arc/projects/groupname/]
    Resources --> Storage[üíæ Storage Quotas]
    Resources --> Containers[üê≥ Container Access]
```

### Creating and Managing Groups

**Access the Group Management Interface:**

[**üîó CADC Group Management**](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/groups/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

#### Step 1: Create a New Group

1. Click **"New Group"**
2. Provide a meaningful group name (e.g., `myproject-team`)
3. Add a brief description of the project or collaboration
4. Click **"Create"**

#### Step 2: Add Members

1. Find your group in the list
2. Click **"Edit"** in the Membership column
3. Type the name (not username) of your collaborator
4. Select from the search results
5. Click **"Add member"**

!!! tip "Finding Users"
    The search function uses real names, not CADC usernames. Search for "John Smith" rather than "jsmith".

#### Step 3: Assign Administrators

1. Click **"Edit"** in the Administrators column  
2. Add users who should be able to manage the group
3. Administrators can add/remove members and modify permissions

### Member Roles

| Role | Permissions | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Administrator** | Full group management, resource allocation | Project PIs, senior team members |
| **Member** | Access shared resources, collaborate | Researchers, grad students |

## üîê Harbor Registry Permissions

Harbor is CANFAR's container registry where container images are stored and managed.

### Access Levels

**Registry URL:** [https://images.canfar.net](https://images.canfar.net)

| Permission Level | Can Do | Cannot Do |
|------------------|--------|-----------|
| **Guest** | Pull public images | Push images, see private repos |
| **Developer** | Pull all group images, push to group repos | Delete images, manage projects |
| **Master** | Full project management | System administration |

### Managing Harbor Access

Harbor permissions are typically managed by CANFAR administrators. Contact [support@canfar.net](mailto:support@canfar.net) to:

- Request access to a project repository
- Set up a new project for your container images
- Modify permissions for team members

### Using Harbor

```bash
# Login to Harbor
docker login images.canfar.net

# Pull a container
docker pull images.canfar.net/skaha/astroml:latest

# Push your container (if you have permissions)
docker push images.canfar.net/myproject/custom-container:v1.0
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Access Control Lists (ACL) {#acl-access-control-lists}

### What are ACLs?

**Access Control Lists (ACLs)** provide fine-grained file and directory permissions beyond traditional POSIX permissions. While POSIX permissions only support owner/group/other with read/write/execute, ACLs allow you to grant specific permissions to individual users and groups.

### Why ACLs Matter in Astronomy

**Traditional POSIX Limitations:**
- Only one group can own a file
- No granular control over multiple collaborators
- Difficult to share data across research groups

**ACL Advantages:**
- Multiple users and groups can have different permissions on the same file
- Grant specific researchers read access to your dataset
- Allow collaborators to write to specific directories
- Maintain security while enabling flexible collaboration

### ACL vs POSIX Comparison

| Scenario | POSIX Permissions | ACL Permissions |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Single collaboration** | `rwxrwx---` (group access) | Same as POSIX |
| **Multi-group project** | Must choose one group | Grant specific access to multiple groups |
| **Guest researcher access** | Add to group or world-readable | Grant individual read access |
| **Selective write access** | All group members can write | Grant write access only to specific users |

### Viewing ACLs

```bash
# View ACL permissions
getfacl /arc/projects/myproject/sensitive_data/

# Output example:
# file: sensitive_data/
# owner: alice
# group: myproject-team
# user::rwx
# user:bob:r--           # Bob has read-only access
# user:carol:rw-         # Carol can read and write
# group::r--             # Group has read-only
# group:external-team:r-- # External group has read access
# mask::rwx
# other::---             # No access for others
```

### Setting ACLs

```bash
# Grant user 'bob' read access to a directory
setfacl -m u:bob:r /arc/projects/myproject/shared_data/

# Grant group 'external-collab' read access
setfacl -m g:external-collab:r /arc/projects/myproject/public_results/

# Grant user 'alice' full access to a file
setfacl -m u:alice:rw /arc/projects/myproject/scripts/analysis.py

# Remove ACL entry
setfacl -x u:bob /arc/projects/myproject/sensitive_data/

# Remove all ACLs
setfacl -b /arc/projects/myproject/temp_data/
```

### ACL Best Practices

**üìÅ Directory Structure with ACLs:**

```text
/arc/projects/myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/          # World-readable results
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: group:world:r)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team/           # Full team access
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: group:myproject-team:rw)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/          # Admin-only access
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: user:pi:rw, group:admins:rw)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ external/       # Controlled external access
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (ACL: user:collaborator:r, group:external-team:r)
```

**üîí Security Guidelines:**

1. **Principle of least privilege** - Grant minimum necessary access
2. **Regular audits** - Review ACLs periodically with `getfacl`
3. **Document permissions** - Keep notes on why specific ACLs were set
4. **Use groups when possible** - Easier to manage than individual user ACLs

## üîå API Authentication

### Overview

CANFAR provides REST APIs for programmatic access to platform features. All API calls require proper authentication.

### Authentication Methods

#### Method 1: Bearer Tokens (Recommended)

**Best for:** Short-term automation, development, interactive use

```bash
# Get a 48-hour token
curl https://ws-cadc.canfar.net/ac/login \
  -d "username=your_username" \
  -d "password=your_password"

# Use token in API calls
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://ws-uv.canfar.net/skaha/v0/session
```

#### Method 2: Proxy Certificates

**Best for:** Long-term automation, file transfers, production scripts

```bash
# Install CADC utilities
pip install cadcutils

# Generate proxy certificate
cadc-get-cert -u your_username

# Certificate stored in ~/.ssl/cadcproxy.pem
# Valid for 10 days, automatically used by CADC tools
```

### API Examples

#### Session Management

```bash
# List active sessions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  https://ws-uv.canfar.net/skaha/v0/session

# Launch new session  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d "name=my-analysis" \
  -d "image=images.canfar.net/skaha/astroml:latest" \
  https://ws-uv.canfar.net/skaha/v0/session

# Delete session
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  https://ws-uv.canfar.net/skaha/v0/session/SESSION_ID
```

#### File Operations (VOSpace)

```bash
# List files
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  https://ws-cadc.canfar.net/vospace/nodes/myproject

# Upload file
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
  --data-binary @local_file.fits \
  https://ws-cadc.canfar.net/vospace/data/myproject/remote_file.fits
```

## üö® Common Permission Issues

### Problem: "Permission Denied" accessing `/arc/projects/`

**Cause:** Not a member of the project group

**Solution:**
1. Contact project administrator to add you to the group
2. Verify group membership at [CADC Group Management](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/groups/)

### Problem: Cannot push to Harbor registry

**Cause:** Insufficient Harbor permissions

**Solution:**
1. Contact [support@canfar.net](mailto:support@canfar.net) to request developer access
2. Verify you're logged into Harbor: `docker login images.canfar.net`

### Problem: API calls return 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Invalid or expired authentication token

**Solution:**
1. Generate new token: `curl https://ws-cadc.canfar.net/ac/login -d "username=..." -d "password=..."`
2. Check token format in Authorization header: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### Problem: ACL changes not taking effect

**Cause:** ACL mask or inheritance issues

**Solution:**
1. Check effective permissions: `getfacl filename`
2. Update ACL mask: `setfacl -m m::rwx filename`
3. Set default ACLs for directories: `setfacl -d -m g:groupname:rw directory/`
