# Getting Access to CANFAR

## Step 1: Request a CADC Account

**First time user?** You need a Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) account to access CANFAR:

[**üîó Request CADC Account**](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

!!! info "Account Processing Time"
    CADC accounts are typically approved within 1-2 business days. The CADC provides
    astronomical data services for the Canadian astronomy community and international
    collaborators.

## Step 2: Get Portal Authorization

Once you have a CADC account, you need authorization to use the CANFAR Science Portal:

### ü§ù Joining an Existing Collaboration

**Already part of a research group using CANFAR?**

1. Ask your collaboration administrator to add you to the group
2. They can do this via the [CADC Group Management Interface](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/groups/)
3. You'll receive access within a few hours

### üÜï New Collaboration

**Starting a new project or collaboration?**

Email [support@canfar.net](mailto:support@canfar.net) with:

- **Subject**: "CANFAR Science Portal Access Request"
- **Project description**: Brief overview of your research
- **Resource requirements**: 
  - Storage needed (GB/TB)
  - Compute cores needed
  - Expected number of users
- **Justification**: 2-3 sentences explaining why you need cloud resources

!!! example "Sample Request"
    ```
    Subject: CANFAR Science Portal Access Request
    
    Hello,
    
    I am requesting access to the CANFAR Science Portal for our galaxy 
    evolution research project. We need approximately 500GB of storage 
    and 8-16 compute cores to process Hubble Space Telescope imaging data.
    
    Our team of 4 researchers requires cloud computing resources to run 
    photometry pipelines that are too computationally intensive for our 
    local machines.
    
    Best regards,
    Dr. Jane Smith
    University of Example
    ```
