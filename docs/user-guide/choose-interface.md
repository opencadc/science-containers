- **Multi-application support** running simultaneously

### Key Applications Available

- **CASA**: Radio interferometry data reduction (all versions)
- **DS9**: FITS image display and analysis
- **TOPCAT**: Interactive catalog analysis and visualization
- **Firefly**: Web-based astronomical image viewer with advanced features
- **Standard Linux tools**: editors, terminals, file managers

### Desktop Sessions vs Desktop Apps

- **Desktop Sessions** (this interface): Full desktop environment, CANFAR team supported
- **Desktop Apps** (custom containers): Individual applications, community contributed

### Optimal for Users Who

- Need CASA for interferometry data reduction
- Want a familiar desktop environment with multiple applications
