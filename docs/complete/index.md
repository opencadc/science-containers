    The authors acknowledge the use of the Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomy Research (CANFAR) Science Platform. Our work used the facilities of the Canadian Astronomy Data Center, operated by the National Research Council of Canada with the support of the Canadian Space Agency, and CANFAR, a consortium that serves the data-intensive storage, access, and processing needs of university groups and centers engaged in astronomy research [(Gaudet et al. 2010)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010SPIE.7740E..1IG/abstract). collaboration, the collaboration lead will need to request access by sending an email to [support@canfar.net](mailto:support@canfar.net) specifying they are requesting access to the CANFAR Science Portal, the scale of resources needed (storage and cores of compute) and a short (few line) resource justification.  Canadian research collaborations are encouraged to apply for CANFAR Science Portal authorization.
