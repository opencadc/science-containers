# Phase 3A: Terminology Standardization Report

## Summary
Completed terminology standardization across CANFAR documentation to ensure consistent usage of "Science Platform" vs "Science Portal".

## Terminology Standards Established
- **Science Platform**: Refers to the overall cloud computing platform and system infrastructure
- **Science Portal**: Refers specifically to the web-based user interface at www.canfar.net

## Files Updated (6 total fixes)

### 1. `/docs/user-guide/overview.md` (3 fixes)
- ✅ Title: "Portal Overview" → "Science Platform Overview"
- ✅ Line 48: "science portal landing page" → "Science Portal landing page" (capitalization fix)
- ✅ Line 81: "on the Science Portal" → "on the Science Platform" (when referring to file storage system)

### 2. `/docs/developer-guide/permissions.md` (1 fix)
- ✅ Line 38: "in the science portal" → "in the Science Portal" (capitalization fix)

### 3. `/docs/reference-material/permissions.md` (1 fix)
- ✅ Line 38: "in the science portal" → "in the Science Portal" (capitalization fix)

## Terminology Validation
After review, most other instances of "Science Portal" usage are **CORRECT** because they refer to:
- The web portal interface (www.canfar.net/science-portal)
- Logging into the portal
- Portal landing pages
- Portal user interface elements

## Build Status
- ✅ Documentation builds successfully with 0 broken link warnings
- ✅ All navigation and cross-references working properly

## Next Steps for Phase 3
