This directory contains information related to the buildbot setup for ADMIT.
Currently, an ADMIT checkout & build is run via buildbot on slave
eris.astro.umd.edu with master chara.astro.umd.edu.  This machine also
serves as the master for CARMA software build slaves. The results are
displayed on http://carma.astro.umd.edu/buildbot.  The htaccess requires
a user/password to display the page.  The linux account
is carmaweb, in the passwd files on eris and chara only (local account).
The buildbot backing store is by default sqlite, however that proved
unstable so we switched to mysql (see Notes below).

Files:

   httpd.conf - apache configuration file so that buildbot results are
                updated on our web server (also chara.astro.umd.edu)

   master.cfg - buildbot configuration file, lives in
                $BUILDBOT/masters/$MASTER/master.cfg, e.g.
                /home/carmaweb/buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.edu/master.cfg


   buildbot.tac.master - this file should be copied to 
                         $BUILDBOT/masters/$MASTER/buildbot.tac

   buildbot.tac.slave- this file should be copied to 
                         $BUILDBOT/masters/$SLAVE/buildbot.tac

   templates  - This directory contains html files used for the 'cover page'
                for the carma.astro.umd.edu buildbot. They belong in  
                $BUILDBOT/masters/$MASTER/templates

   logs.html  - modified version to fix javascript scrolling.  This goes in
                $HOME/buildbot/sandboxes/chara.astro.umd.edu/lib/python2.6/site-packages/buildbot/status/web/templates/logs.html

Buildbot keeps its own version of Python in $BUILDBOT/sandboxes/[machine]/lib, 
so you have to pip-install Python modules required to compile your code
on the slave's buildbot Python (NOT on the system Python) using virtualenv
(example in Notes).  For ADMIT:

 pip install numpy 
 pip install matplotlib 
 pip install sphinx 
 pip install numpydoc

(sphinx can fail on some machines due to a zlib issue on docutils,
see the $ADMIT/INSTALL for details how to get around this)

==============================================================
Notes
==============================================================

These are my notes from the eris/chara buildbot installation. - MWP


To start the buildbot master: On chara, run ~/bin/buildbot-start-master
To start the buildbot slave: On eris, run ~/bin/buildbot-start-slave
To stop the buildbot slave: On eris, run ~/bin/buildbot-stop-slave

The above needs to be done on master or any slave machine that has been
rebooted recently.  Master machine is chara, correlator-x86_64 and
carma-full-x86_64 slave machine is eris.  Ask Marc for the ssh passphrase.

*** Make sure you don't start the above processes in a screen because
after you log out of screen, cvs checkout will fail with:

  gnome-ssh-askpass:2177): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: localhost:10.0
  Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password).
  cvs [checkout aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages if any)


To add or change builds edit the file:
buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.edu/master.cfg
and restart master and slave.

These packages are required
yum install keychain
yum install blas-devel
yum install lapack-devel
yum install python-pip
yum install python-virtualenv


Mon Jun  4 10:23:25 EDT 2012 - MWP
chara OS upgrade to SL6.2

Required re-installing buildbot for python 2.6,
this upgraded buildbot to version 0.8.6p1.

1. Remove (or move) old sandboxes, then

 virtualenv --no-site-packages $HOME/buildbot/sandboxes/`hostname`
 echo $HOSTNAME
 source $HOME/buildbot/sandboxes/$HOSTNAME/bin/activate
 pip install MySQL-python  [Order matters here, Mysql THEN buildbot!]
 pip install buildbot 

For slaves:
 buildbod-stop-slave
 buildslave create-slave /eris/carmaweb/buildbot/slaves/$HOSTNAME
 pip install buildbot-slave
 pip install numpy
 pip install matplotlib
 pip install sphinx
 pip install numpydoc


cp /n/eris/carmaweb/buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.edu/master.cfg $HOME/master.cfg.save
mv /n/eris/carmaweb/buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.edu /n/eris/carmaweb/buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.eduOLD


buildbot create-master --db="mysql://buildbotuser:1amaB0t@localhost/buildbot" /n/eris/carmaweb/buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.edu
buildbot upgrade-master /n/eris/carmaweb/buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.edu

Template files may have changed, which will give python errors displayed to the web page.
e.g.
sandboxes/chara.astro.umd.edu/lib/python2.6/site-packages/buildbot/status/web/templates/root.html

differs from masters/chara.astro.umd.edu/templates/root.html so copy over new template
and re-add carma-specific changes.

** CARMA specific templates are saved in $HOME/templates.save

Switching from sqlite to mysql since sqlite was giving us problems under SL6.2;
constant database locking hangs up the buildbot master.
Note: mysql-python must be installed BEFORE buildbot.

See:

http://readthedocs.org/docs/buildbot/en/v0.8.6/manual/cfg-global.html
http://16degrees.com.au/roller5/gmcdonald/entry/upgrade_buildbot_from_0_7

0. Edit /etc/my.cnf , add utf8 lines. Do NOT add InnoDB.

[mysqld]
default-character-set   = utf8
default-collation       = utf8_general_ci
character-set-client    = utf8

[mysql]
default-character-set   = utf8

1. Create buildbot database in our existing mysql
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:  [Ask Peter or Marc]

Edit buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.edu/master.cfg
Change db :

buildbot upgrade-master /n/eris/carmaweb/buildbot/masters/chara.astro.umd.edu




Restarting:
===========
May 2015: The current master (chara) seems to reboot itself more than is expected,
    in which case the local MD gurus will need to manually restart it for 
    service:


ssh carmaweb@eris: "(buildbot-stop-slave && rm -rf /eris/carmaweb/buildbot/slaves/eris.astro.umd.edu/ADMIT/build)"

ssh carmaweb@chara buildbot-start-master  (there is no "stop master")

carmaweb@eris buildbot-start-slave  

You may be asked the ssh key passphrase: 1....t  (ask around what this passphrase is)

Normally one does not need the "rm" command but chara rebooting
unexpectedly seems to live the directory in a funny state that
prevents the slave from writing.
