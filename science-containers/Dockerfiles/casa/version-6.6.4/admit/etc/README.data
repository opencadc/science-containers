Your ADMIT directory comes with many files, which are normally nicely
organized in your web view once you point at the index.html file, e.g.

	  chrome your_data.admit/index.html

This will show the ADMIT flow.   If you want to recompute a flow with
new settings, open up CASA, and issue the following commands

    import admit
    p = admit.Project('your_data.admit',dataserver=True)

In this document we describe in some details the naming conventions
of the files you might see.  The naming structure will be something like:


      x.<bdp_abbreviation_name>



admit.xml    state of ADMIT (all registered BDP's and AT's, Summary etc.)
admit.log    cumulative log file from ADMIT runs (flowcount 1,2,3....)
admit0.py    latest python script for re-run
admitN.py    optional pipeline-based recepi script (N=1,2,3....)
*.apar       any optional apar files that were used by an admit recipe on flowcount=1
admit.dot    flow graph in DOT format
admit.png    flow graph in PNG format
index.html   base 
resources/   helper resources
