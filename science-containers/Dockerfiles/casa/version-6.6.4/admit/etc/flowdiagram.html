    This diagram is a directed acyclic graph representing the ADMIT Task
    connections for the flow.  Each arrow represents the connection from an ADMIT
    task output to the input of another ADMIT Task.  The integer next to each
    arrow is the zero-based index of the ADMIT Task's output BDP.  Note any
    output BDP may be used as the input for more than one ADMIT Task.
