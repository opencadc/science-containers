This will be a list of optional packages you can install with ADMIT.
Having them will greatly enhance the things you can do with your data,
but they are technically not needed to get started.

It is up to you to install them with the CASA version of python (if
compatible), or your own system version, or some other third party
version (e.g. Enthought), or even in your own PYTHONPATH.  ADMIT will
generally not depend on these.

For a number of these packages you will need a developers setup, tools
like C/C++/Cython etc. Consult the "see also" link if your install
fails in the simple way.

For some of the packages, alternative installation methods will be
available, check with your local system (.e.g. pip)

0) Before you panic and think you need to install all of these, check
   which ones your python already installed these modules.

    cd $ADMIT/integration-test
    make check

   and see which versions your python (listed on the first line) has.

   Although most tools should install using the

	python setup.py install
   or
	python setup.py install --user

   Another option is to use casa's environment modifier:


        casa-config --exec python setup.py
   or
	casa-config --exec python setup.py install --user


1) radio-astro-tools

   These are a few FITS specific packages developed April 2014 onwards.

   a) spectral-cube
      =============
    


      To install:
      -----------
      git clone https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/spectral-cube
      cd spectral-cube
      python setup.py install

      >> import spectral_cube

   b) signal-id
      =========

      To install:
      -----------
      git clone https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/signal-id
