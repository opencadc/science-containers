\item[Description:]

A CubeSum is a moment map that is computed before any line
identification/line cube is created.  That is, it is a sum over all
emission lines in the cube.  It serves as a reference map where reliable
signal is located, simply adding up all signal more than factor * sigma.

sigma can be a single number for the cube.  or can vary as function of
frequency, and/or a polynomial fit can be used to subtract it as a continuum
like signal, and only the positive numbers are added into the moment map.
