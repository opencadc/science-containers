A Description Vector assigns a simple value or vector to something
that you want described from your cube, set of cubes, or any property
you like to describe and can be abstracted into a number or small set
of numbers.

If you do this for many datasets, this smaller dimensionality of the
description vector allows you to find correlations between the datasets,
isolate interesting groups of datasets etc.

One common approach is a Principle Component Analysis.
