Here you will find a description of all the BDP we use or plan to use:
Ignoring all the inter-related hierarchies of 
      "projects/sources/fields/sous/gous/mous"
we drill down to a series of BandCube's per one of those

BandCube[nbands]              normally in freq space
  Summary
  CubeStats
  CubeSum                     a mom0 like map of all emission (for PV)
  CubeSpectrum   
  SpectralMap
  PVSlice
  PVCorr 
  ContinuumMap                what about spectral index ?
  LineList                    
    LineCube                  normally in doppler space and regridded
    LineCubeMom0
    LineCubeMom1
    LineCubeMom2
