\subsection{Spectral Map}
\begin{description}
\item[Type:] SpectralMap
\item[Description:]

This will contain a series of tables, each representing a spectrum at a
point in the cube, single point (with optional averaging over a region
or channels)?.  The task to create a Spectral map may have an interactive 
counterpart where points can be added.

\item[Constituents:]: BDP\_Table

\item[ADMIT Task:] AT\_SpectralMap \\
   - locations where spectra are to be taken \\
   - [optional region/channels to average?] 

\item[CASA Task(s):]  TBD

\item[Input BDP(s):]
A spectral cube 

\item[Output BDP(s):]

For each spatial location, a table composed of two columns: \\
   frequency (in GHz, middle of channel) \\
   data      intensity, Jy/Beam
