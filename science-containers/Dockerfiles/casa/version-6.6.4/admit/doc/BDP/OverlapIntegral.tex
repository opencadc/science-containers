\subsection{Overlap Integral}
\begin{description}
\item[Type:] OverlapIntegral
\item[Description:]

This map shows regions of the field where emission of various spectral
lines overlaps (or doesn't overlap). This map (FITS or JPG) can only be
constructed after a set of zero moments has been created.  

One can either create RGB type combinations of a selected set of lines
or by assigning a different bit in a bitmask of emission if that line is
present (over a cliplevel).

The number of zero moments is between 2 and 8, with a typical number
being 3 for RGB output and up to 8 for bitmask output.

The OverlapIntegral could be generalized to Cubes as well but that
is beyond the scope of our initial deliverable.

\item[Constituents:]: BDP\_Image

\item[ADMIT Task:]  AT\_OverlapIntegral

\item[CASA Task(s):] TBD

\item[Input BDP(s):] At least two Moment0 maps

\item[Output BDP(s):]  Image (JPG or other format) representation of where
emission from each input moment map overlaps.
