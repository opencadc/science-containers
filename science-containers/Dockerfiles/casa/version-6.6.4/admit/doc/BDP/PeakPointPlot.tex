\subsection{Peak Point Plot}
\begin{description}
\item[Type:] PeakPointPlot
\item[Description:]

PeakPointPlot takes a list of positions (x,y) and intensities (the maximum
through the cube at each given point) and plots each with a symbol size
related to the intensity value. The list is created by CubeStats as an option
(though will become default). The plot should be an interesting bubble diagram,
also good input for moment of inertia to get the initial condition for
a PVSlice.

\item[Constituents:]: BDP\_Image + BDP\_Table

\item[ADMIT Task:] AT\_PeakPointPlot \\
    Keywords: list of [x,y,intensity] 

\item[CASA Task(s):] TBD

\item[Input BDP(s):] CubeStats

\item[Output BDP(s):] A PNG diagram (and thumbnail?), and the
original data as a table.
