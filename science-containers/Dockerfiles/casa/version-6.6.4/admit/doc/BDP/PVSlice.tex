\subsection{Position-Velocity Slice}
\begin{description}
\item[Type:] PVSlice
\item[Description:]

This is a position-velocity slice through a section of the cube that has
been selected in a deterministic way.  How the slice is cut in RA-DEC
is determined from either CubeSum's moments of inertia, or a map of the
CubeStats::maxpos column, again via a moments of inertia.

Other than another nice diagnostic for people to look at (notably the JPG
version), the PVSlice can be used by PVCorr to create a cross-correlation
in the V direction to compute the input for a LineList generator. Since
the selected emission for this is limited to where the strongest (or 
a selected) line in PV space is, this generally increases the detection
likelihood for weak lines and also convolves out any velocity (frequency)
uncertainties in the line identification process.
