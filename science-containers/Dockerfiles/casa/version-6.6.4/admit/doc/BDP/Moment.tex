\begin{description}
\item[Type:] Moment
\item[Description:]
 A moment of emission computed from a spectral map.  Available moments 
 are:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Zeroth Moment : Integrated emission over some channel range
 \item First Moment :  Centroid velocity over some channel range
 \item Second Moment : Velocity dispersion over some channel range
 \end{itemize}

\item[Constituents:]: BDP\_Image

\item[ADMIT Task:] AT\_Moment
  Keywords:  \\
     - moment to compute - 0,1,2 \\
     - channel (velocity, frequency) range over which to compute \\
     - method to compute, possible methods include:\\
           simple clip  \\
           primary beam weighted clip \\
           Gaussian fit  \\
           Using emission features from FeatureList BDP \\
     - optionally correct velocity dispersion for mean motion \\
    
\item[CASA Task(s):]  TBD

\item[Input BDP(s):]
A spectral cube.  Optional: FeatureList if using that method

\item[Output BDP(s):]

Two-dimensional image of the requested moment of emission, and thumbnail image
