\subsection{Position-Velocity Correlation}

\item[Type:] PVCorr
\item[Description:]

A PVcorr table is a cross-correlation of a known (usually also strong)
line from a PVSlice diagram with other lines. It is like dragging the
clipped (or polygoned) emission of that emission in the V direction
and computing the cross-correlation.
