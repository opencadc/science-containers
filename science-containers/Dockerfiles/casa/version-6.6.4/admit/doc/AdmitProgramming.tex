\section{Overview}

In this guide you will learn how to write python programs in ADMIT style.

\subsection{pipeline}

A general pipeline can be as complex as any scripting language allows,
including various loops, decisions, state changes of variables
and datasets. However, we desire to have a pipeline where the user
can recompute selected BDP, but also replace a BDP with a different

For ADMIT we are setting up a pipeline with a few
restrictions:

\begin{itemize}

\item

The pipeline products (the BDP's) must have a clear lineage and be
recomputed via a single ADMIT task

% not quite directed acyclic graph (DAG) as this:
% en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph

\item
An ADMIT task has input BDPs and output BDPs, but an output BDP is not
allowed to change its state, therefore adding complexity to the dependancy
of the BDP

\end{itemize}

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

b1:
	echo B1 > b1

b2:	b1
	echo B1-2 > b2

b3:	b1 b2
	echo B1+B2 > b3

b4 b5:	b3
	echo B3-4 > b4
	echo B3-5 > b5
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{Single FITS}


\section{Simple Table}

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
> a=atable.ATable()
> t=a.pload('cubestats.bin')
> t.show()
table: 5 cols x 246 rows
col_names:  ['channel', 'frequency', 'max', 'sigma', 'medabsdevmed']
col_types:  []
col_units:  []


> atable.ATable(filename="cubestats.bin").show()
table: 5 cols x 246 rows
col_names:  ['channel', 'frequency', 'max', 'sigma', 'medabsdevmed']
col_types:  []
col_units:  []


\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\section{Use Cases}
 
\subsection{upgrading your own tools to be part of the admit pipeline}

First, why would you spend the energy to do this? It can be painful. If your
output data don't fit in one of the standard BDP's (the BDP\_buckett fits anything
though) you would have to write a new BDP\_foobar, and of course wrap your
code in an AT\_foobar, create a DTD if you do have a BDB\_foobar.

\section{Installation}

\begin{verbatim}

See also $ASTUTE/INSTALL

1) 
      wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
      python get-pip.py      
      pip install astropy


2)

\end{verbatim}

\item {\bf line}

The word ``line'' is often used to refer to a Molecular Line or Line Transition
that ADMIT attempts to isolate from the SPWcube.
We have ADMIT products such as {\it LineList} and {\it LineCube}.
The ADMIT pipeline encodes line names (optionally) in the filename, once lines have 
been identified.  Examples are for CO(1-0) would be {\tt CO-115.27} and 
N$_2$H$^+$ would be {\tt N2HP-93.17}. Unidentified lines will go by
names such as {\tt U-98.75}.
