Deployment of ADMIT:
--------------------

There are various models on how ADMIT can be installed and distributed., we
concentrate on the two obvious ones:


1) completely outside of CASA, we use $ADMIT and initialize things by
   sourcing the appropriate "admit_start.csh" file.  The $ADMIT
   directory can live anywhere, and users will see a $ADMIT in their
   shell environment.

   This can be a useful environment for developers, and we call this
   the developer environment.


2) Use the setup.py file so the command

   casa-config --exec python setup.py install [--user]

   would work. This essentially just copies the admit/admit and admit/etc
   tree into the right location in the site-packages tree inside of CASA's
   python.

   With the --user option one should be able to install admit without the
   need for write permission into the casa tree.

   However, casa is not just (i)python, this will probably not work without
   modifications to .casa's init.py and/or prelude.py files.


2a) At NRAO the casa-admit command will give access to the ADMIT enabled
    version of casa, with the usual '-ls' command line option to find out
    which versions were installed, and the '-r' option to access another
    version.

    However, this approach does not make it easy to access the ADMIT unix
    scripts. Short of following NRAO's approach of making shadow copies,
    you can also enable your $PATH for this casa, and thus enable more
    commands.
   
    The recipe for this is in BASH is as follows:

    casa_root=`casa-config-admit --prefix`
    export PATH=$casa_root/bin:$casa_root:$PATH
    export ADMIT=`admit_root`

    The setting of $ADMIT is optional, but will save a lot of time
    re-computing it each time.


    See the script in $ADMIT/scripts/redo_deploy to see how this deployment
    works in practice.
