\subsection{AT Design Example}

All AT designs must include
\begin{itemize}
\item Description of purpose of this AT.
\item At least one example use case that demonstrates how this AT
      fits in a typical flow.
\item Description of input BDP(s), but note that the detailed contents of the BDPs are described
in Appendix~\ref{s-bdptypes}.
\item Description of required and optional keywords.
\item Description of output BDP(s), and their optional output graphics. The 
naming convention of output BDP(s) is also useful to add here, as they 
are normally automated (some AT's allow you to set them explicitly).
\item The procedure the AT uses to achieve its goals.
\item What CASA tasks (or tools) it uses.
\end{itemize}
