\subsection{Moment Design}

\subsubsection{Description}
 A moment of emission computed from a spectral map.  Available moments 
 are:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Zeroth Moment : Integrated emission over some channel range
 \item First Moment :  Centroid velocity over some channel range
 \item Second Moment : Velocity dispersion over some channel range
 \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Use Case}

% reminder from Lee; it once was on the blackboard on the left side during the sept F2F
Although this task may seem like a simple interface to the CASA immoments task/tool,
there are some common procedures people employ to create mom 0,1,2 using a more
complex relationship that employs a mask. We should describe that here and 
encapsulate that with some special option or flag given.
