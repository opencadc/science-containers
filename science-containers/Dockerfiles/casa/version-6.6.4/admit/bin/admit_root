#
#   return $ADMIT (admit_root) for those who don't have it in a
#   CASA environment. To speed up your scripts, you are adviced to
#         setenv ADMIT `admit_root`
#   or
#         export ADMIT=`admit_root`
#
#   Since admit_root.py is very verbose (despite --quiet and --nologger)
#   this front-end is needed that filters out the last line "leaving casapy..."
#   and the very last line should be the real admit_root
#
#   On my ubuntu (casa 4.6 is very verbose) this adds a 9 second overhead
#   to calling an admit recipe!!!  Hence you are adviced to use $ADMIT
#   In the developer environment $ADMIT is already known, and the overhead
#   is a mere 0.01 sec
